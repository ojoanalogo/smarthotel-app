# SmartHotel-NS

This was my 2nd mobile project, I was learning how to use NativeScript and TypeScript. Beware, there is a lot of spaghetti code that shouldn't be seen

## Overview

I wanted to create a POC for IoT implementation in hotels, as part of it I created a mobile app which guests can use to request services to the hotel staff and also have remote control of their room (turning on/off appliances and setting up the thermostat)

The app uses Google Places API, Firebase for mobile notifications and Angular with TypeScript.

Requires web services to function https://github.com/mxarc/smarthotel-ws

## Features

- Room management
- Places near me
- Login
